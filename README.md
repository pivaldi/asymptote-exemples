# Extensive examples of Asymptote codes

[Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/) is a descriptive vector
graphics language that provides a natural coordinate-based framework
for technical drawing.

## About this repo

This repository contains extensive examples of Asymptote code and
provides an "Howto" by example from basic to advanced feature.  
[Some examples use personal Asymptote modules](https://github.com/pivaldi/asymptote-packages).

## Visualizing the examples

[The command line Asymptote Examples Builder](https://github.com/pivaldi/asymptote-exemples-builder)
allows to build a set of `HTML` pages to visualize pictures and codes side by side.
