# Extensive examples of Asymptote codes

[Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/) is a descriptive vector
graphics language that provides a natural coordinate-based framework
for technical drawing.

## About this repo

This repository contains extensive examples of Asymptote code and
provides an "Howto" by example from basic to advanced feature.  
Some examples use personal modules that can be found [here](https://github.com/pivaldi/asymptote-packages).

## Visualizing the examples

A command line interface is coming soon to generate all the pictures
and a set of `HTML` pages to visualize pictures and codes side by
side.  
Soâ€¦ Keep in touch watching this repository ;)
