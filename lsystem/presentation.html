An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and
a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of
symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production
rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an
initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a
mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric
structures.
