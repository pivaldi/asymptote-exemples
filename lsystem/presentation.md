From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system](Wikipedia.org) :

> An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and
> a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of
> symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production
> rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an
> initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a
> mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric
> structures.
