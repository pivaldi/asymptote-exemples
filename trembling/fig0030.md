When trembling is enabled with the routine **startTrembling**, all
(most ?) doted points become "magnetic" automatically.  
So, if a path passes through a magnetized point with an numerous
precision defined by **magneticRadius** (unit is bp in postscript
coordinates), the resulting distorted path will also pass through the
point.
